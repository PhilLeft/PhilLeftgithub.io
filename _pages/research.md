### **Genetic Pest Management**

<br/><img src='/images/13990891822229_medfly_1.png'>

 My research is based in the emerging field of genetic pest management, focusing particularly on the agricultural pests *Ceratitis capitata* (medfly), and vector arthropods such as the mosquito *Aedes aegypti*. 

Summaries of my previous work in medfly can be read [here](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbzz4/a-bioengineered-solution-to-one-of-agricultures-most-devious-pests-medflies) or an interview with BBC Science in Action can be found [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p024bsk9) (my section from 7'28" onwards)


### **Gut microbes and behaviour**
I also work to investigate the effects of gut microbes on mate choice in fruitflies (*Drosophila* and medfly) and explore these effects in terms of the evolutionary associations between hosts and their symbionts.
