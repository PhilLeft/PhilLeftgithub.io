In collaboration with [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/educators/), we have produced a series of self-serve molecular biology lessons that can be carried out by anyone! 


Each lesson is structured to provide background for biology learners of all levels and include tutorials and exercises on Benchling to simulate each concept. Try them out today!


This is an ongoing collaboration, so watch this space for future developments and please contact me for more information, or to provide any feedback. 

# ASMCUE 2021

I gave an Educational "microbrew" talk at the American Society for Microbiology 2021 meeting - [here](https://github.com/Philip-Leftwich/Philip-Leftwich.github.io/blob/master/files/Leftwich_Philip_handout_updated_V2.pdf) is a copy of the handout I produced for the event.
