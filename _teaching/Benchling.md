In collaboration with [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/educators/), we have produced a series of self-serve molecular biology lessons that can be carried out by anyone! 
Each lesson is structured to provide background for biology learners of all levels and include tutorials and exercises on Benchling to simulate each concept. Try them out today!
This is an ongoing collaboration, so watch this space for future developments! 

Please contact me for more information, or to provide any feedback.
